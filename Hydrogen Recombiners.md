actually called this [Passive autocatalytic recombiner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_autocatalytic_recombiner) (Wikipedia) but this is a word jumble 

Most popular company that makes these is Framatone - which is a nuclear reactor based company. 

Hydrogen Recombiners are nifty devices that are integral to BWRs (and really most reactors). In the event of the zirconium alloy [[Cladding|cladding]] on fuel rods mixing with the water, hydrogen is created, and this gas can lead to devastating explosions ([[Fukushima Reactor Incident]])

Recombiners have plates/pellets coated with platinum or palladium catalyst (palladium was also used in iron man????). On the surface of the catalyst, the molecules react chemically at a low temp & low hydrogen concentration - starting spontaneously at 1-2% hydrogen (the burning of hydrogen requires 4% with the flashpoint being much higher). The recombiner is a box open from the bottom and from the top. 

The reaction inside of the recombiner reaches a very high temperature (not burning the hydrogen bc the hydrogen flammable concentration has not reached the point.) The reaction causes a positive feedback loop as hot steam rises, increasing airflow.

The recombiner is only efficient up to ~5 kg of hydrogen gas per hour, requiring multiple recombiners to maximum effectiveness in the event of a nuclear incident
