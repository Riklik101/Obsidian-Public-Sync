# Ground level view
Water goes through the [[RPV]] first, where the reaction between fuel rods and control rods creates steam. this steam is through steam dryers and separators, then that steam is moved through steam pipes into the turbines, then into a condenser, and then (generally) is returned back into the RPV.
