A [[PWR reactor]] design, it is designed by [[Framatone]], and the name is the European Pressurized reactor. 
The design service lifetime is 60 years. 

(This is mostly paraphrased from wikipedia :3)

The main objectives is to be more economically competitive and still deliver power. 
It was designed to use uranium more efficiently then gen2 reactors, as it is a gen3 - and it uses "approximately 17% less uranium per kWh generated".

The EPR design has several active and passive protection measures against accidents:

- Four independent emergency cooling systems, each providing the required cooling of the [decay heat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decay_heat "Decay heat") (i.e., 300% redundancy)
- Leak-tight containment around the reactor
- An extra container and cooling area if a molten core manages to escape the reactor (see [containment building](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Containment_building "Containment building") and [core catcher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_catcher "Core catcher"))
	- [[Containment Building]]
- Two-layer concrete wall with a total thickness of 2.6 m, designed to withstand impact by aeroplanes and internal overpressure, and a low vacuum in the annulus space between the two layers
