Reactor Pressure Vessel - contains all of the reactor heat.

In [[BWR reactor]]s, the RPV contains the reactor core - basically the entirety of the main reactor assembly. The RPV is designed to withstand a very large amount of force considering that in a BWR it must withstand the pressure that both it operates at and at emergency designs -- this is due to the fact that in most designs, the RPV isn't considered to be at major risk: even during a major LOCA the RPV is considered to be at healthy conditons (this is a very huge simplification, as there are many, MANY systems in place in the event of a RPV rupture).

This is an diagram of such a RPV (in a BWR - that is important as a PWR uses a different system - a PWR does not have the same steam considerations) RPV ![[Pasted image 20250604223257.png]]

## Interesting aside of the control rods
Interestingly, all of the control rods literally stick into the downcomer (waterfilled) region of the reactor, and that brings up the consideration -- how does the RPV seal these rods to prevent water leakage? This is extremely important, as otherwise _highly_ radioactive water can leak out and cause major damage to the resulting plant (well, major is an overstatement, it will primarily leak out into probably the control rods mechanisms and there are safety systems to control this.)
