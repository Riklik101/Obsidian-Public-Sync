A boiling water reactor uses [[Light Water]] as both coolant and neutron moderator. The second most used reactor, next to the [[PWR reactor]]s, there are approximately 75 in current operation. 

The efficiency of these reactors is about 46%, with 33-34% in practice. 

Enriched uranium is used as nuclear fuel, as light water absorbs too many neutrons to use [[Uranium]] that is natural. 

Light water is not as good of a moderator compared to [[Heavy Water]] or graphite, but it is good as in the event of a LOCA or steam overflow, moderation with stop resulting in the chain reaction ceasing, 

### Pressures for operation
BWRs operate at high pressures, as the water can remain in liquid form at higher temperatures (similar to how a PWR works, however that is the unintended result). Since pressure in BWRs are lower then PWRs, the specific power is less, and the BWR must be larger to provide the same power. The walls, however, can be more thin, and costs are essentially balanced out,

### Water flow
Since there is only one primary loop, water that is in the RPV goes directly to the turbines. Therefore, less water needs to flow through a BWR compared to a PWR, however, if there is a leak, the water is *highly* radioactive, Therefore, even non-reactor parts of the plant must be highly shielded against incidents.

### Control rod placement
Control rods are placed in the bottom of the reactor, rather then the top, as the top is taken up by the steam dryer, steam separator, etc. There is a higher reactivity of the fuel due to its moderation, and control rods are needed to change reactivity as necessary. 

Control rods are controlled by the [[Control Rod Drive]] system

## BWR Plant Layout
In a BWR plant, there are many different buildings containing the structures for the reactor. 

### Containment Building
This building has the RCS, Drywell, Suppression Pool, Upper Pool, alongside systems
### Turbine Building
Contains turbine and all equipment and auxiliary equipment
### Auxiliary Building
Contains safety systems, fuel storage and shipping
### Control Building
Houses MCR, and control + electrical systems
### Diesel Generation Building
This hosts the diesel generators and emergency supplies
### Radwaste Building
This houses systems to process radioactive substances made by the plant
### Intake Building
Houses equipment that provides for heat management of the plant. 

## Emergency Operations
In an emergency, the [[Emergency Core Cooling Systems]] will activate.
