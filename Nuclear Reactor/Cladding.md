Cladding is the thin walled metal tube that composes the outside of a fuel rod.
It's purpose is to prevent corrosion of the fuel by the coolant & release of fission contents into the coolant. Although zirconium alloy is common, aluminum and stainless steel is also used. 
## Cladding Types
Zirconium alloy has been used for so long due to it's properties being very good for nuclear reactors.
* New research suggests that there is an alternative - SiGA cladding. This cladding is made from silicon carbide-- silicon and carbon in a crystalline format. It is able to survive very high temperatures but is brittle.
* They plan on solving this by incorporating the fiber into its cladding, reinforcing the material metaphorically like repair into concrete. 

### Zirconium Cladding Safety Issue
The issue with using zirconium alloy is that upon contact with STEAM (which may occur during a large scale LOCA), it reacts to form the highly flammable hydrogen gas. [[Hydrogen Recombiners]] can be used to manage this, however. 

This reaction is accelerated at high temperatures.
(This also occurs in heavy water reactors such as the CANDU reactor.)

This reaction is the direct cause of the Three Mile Island Nuclear Incident. This was also the cause of the [[Fukushima Reactor Incident]]-- where when the generators went out, hydrogen gas was vented into the reactor maintenance halls, and it reached a high enough concentration to explode. This reaction was also occured during chernobyl - where steam from the reactor escaped.

Furthermore, during a possible LOCA, [[Hydrogen Embrittlement]] can occur, where 5-20% of the released hdyrogen gas diffuses into the cladding forming zirconium hydrides. This process also weakens the rods cladding due to the lower ductility, forming blisters and cracks. 
### Why is zirconium alloy cladding used?
It is mainly used due to its high strength and low neutron absorption. IT can be subjected to a high strain rate and harsh conditions regardless of other means. 

Furthermore, it is exceptionally resistant to corrosion and high temperatures, and it absorbs minimal neutrons produced by nuclear fission

Zirconium in general is also used by the chemical industry, and in the medical industry as it is called zirconia and used for dental and surgical implants due to its biocompatibility and durability.
