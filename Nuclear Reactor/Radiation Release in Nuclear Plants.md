In general, nuclear plants are heavily regulated in terms of how much radiation they are able to release.
# Material Release
Materials used in nuclear plants (such as [[BWR reactor]]s) that are irradiated commonly throughout operation can include
* [[RPV]]
* Primary cooling system
* [[Containment Building]]
	* shouldn't normally experience radiation, but in the event of an accident, may experience it in general
However, importantly, according to the [[NRC]], "*most of an operating nuclear plant's direct radiation is blocked by its steel and concrete structures.*" (See also: [[Containment Building]])
These materials shouldn't normally be included in such release. However, in the decommissioning of such plants, it is possible for these structures to become exposed, through natural disasters or other means. However, according to [World Nuclear](https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/nuclear-waste/decommissioning-nuclear-facilities):
*Apart from some surface contamination of plant, the remaining radioactivity comes from "activation products" in steel which has long been exposed to neutron irradiation, notably the reactor pressure vessel. Stable atoms are changed into different isotopes such as iron-55, iron-59 and zinc-65. Several are highly radioactive, emitting gamma rays. However, their half life is such (2.7 years, 45 days, 5.3 years, 245 days respectively) after 50 years from closedown their radioactivity is much diminished and the occupational risk to workers largely gone.*
