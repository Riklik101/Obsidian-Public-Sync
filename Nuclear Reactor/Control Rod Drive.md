The CRD system in a [[Nuclear Reactor]] is crucial for its operation. The CRD is composed of a few subsystems.
## Fine Motion Control Rod Drive (FMCRD)
The FMCRD is responsible for providing electric motor driven positioning for normal insertion, withdrawal. It also provides electric motor run-in of all control rods that is separated from the hydraulically controlled SCRAM system, simultaneous with SCRAM. 

The FMCRD is also responsible for the hydraulic scram system, accompanied by the HCU
## Hydraulic Control Unit
The HCU contains high pressure water that has enough water pressure for the SCRAM of *two* FMCRDs. the HCU is also a flow path from purging the water to drive rods during normal operation
## Control Rod Drive Hydraulic (CRDH)
The CRDH has high pressure demineralized water, regulated and controlled to charge each HCU scram accumulators, purge water, and provide backup water to the RPV when feedwater flow is down.
