In it's most simplest form, a nuclear reactor uses uranium and other radioactive materials and the fission from uranium to create heat, and transfer that heat into steam to create power. Nuclear reactors are one of the biggest sources of energy, although not renewable, uranium has a very high energy density resulting in massive power transmissions. 

There are many different types of nuclear reactors, and this term serves as a broad hub/introduction for each type. 

## Pressurized Water Reactor
A [[PWR reactor]] is the most common type of reactor. The water in this type of reactor is pressurized, so that water can be used as coolant; the boiling point of water increases as it's pressure increases.

In this type, there are two loops of water: hot water flowing through the [[RPV]] and the water that turns into steam and spins the turbine; this water meets the RPV water through a heat exchanger. 

Since water remains a liquid throughout operation, control rods can be placed at the top, allowing for maximum safety during plant transients. 

### European Pressurized Reactor
The [[EPR Reactor]] is a PWR-type reactor designed by [[Framatone]], designed to be more economically competitive. 
## Boiling Water Reactor
A [[BWR reactor]] is the second most common type of reactor. In this reactor, water directly goes throughout the plant as it heats into steam, that is used to spin turbines for electricity. Since water stays throughout the plant in one coolant loop, control rods are placed at the bottom - as steam goes into the top of the RPV.

Control rods placement at the top requires a specialized [[Control Rod Drive]] system to be used. This is because gravity cannot help in a scram: some type of power is necessary to move the reactors rods in both positioning and emergency events. 

Another interesting side note is that since there is only one coolant loop, radioactive water is present everywhere in the plant, meaning that if the turbines or any other place experience a leak, it is almost certainly the release of radioactive water. (Excluding some subsystems present in every plant)
