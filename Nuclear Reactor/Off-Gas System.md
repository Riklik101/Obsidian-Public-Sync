[[BWR reactor]] offgas system is used for condensers as some gases are made that cannot be condensed. If the condenser has to vent to the offgas open due to high pressure this is the treatement process

Basically what happens is that it goes throughs ome treatments and then exits thorught the plant stack, and this is all monitored to comply with regulatory standards.

Yes — **eventually**, the **BWR off-gas system vents to the atmosphere**, **but** it goes through **several treatment stages first** to reduce or delay radioactive releases.

### 🔷 Overview:

The **BWR Off-Gas System** is designed to **collect, process, delay, and monitor** non-condensable gases (including some radioactive isotopes), and then **vent the cleaned gas to the atmosphere through the plant stack** under controlled conditions.

### 🔹 Here's the Flow:

1. **Source**:  
    Non-condensables (mostly **H₂, O₂, N₂**, and small amounts of radioactive gases like **xenon, krypton**, and **tritium**) come from:
    
    - Condenser (air in-leakage)
        
    - Steam radiolysis
        
    - Minor fuel leakage (fission product gases)
        
2. **Air ejectors or vacuum pumps**:
    
    - Extract gases from the **condenser shell side**
        
    - Send them to the **off-gas treatment system**
        
3. **Off-Gas Treatment System** (before venting):
    
    - **Off-gas condenser**: removes residual steam
        
    - **Catalytic recombiner**: converts explosive **H₂ + O₂ → H₂O**
        
    - **Moisture separator / cooler**
        
    - **Charcoal beds** or **decay tanks** (older systems) to **delay noble gases**
        
        - Decay tanks: 6–12 hours delay to let short-lived isotopes (e.g., Xe-133, Kr-88) decay
            
        - Charcoal beds: adsorb gases; breakthrough monitored
            
    - **Monitors**: radiation levels (particulate, noble gas, iodine channels)
        
4. **Stack Release**:
    
    - Final effluent is discharged via **plant stack** (often 200–300 ft tall)
        
    - Continuously monitored by **radiation monitors**
        
    - Released only if within **Tech Spec and regulatory limits** (10 CFR 20, 10 CFR 50 App I)

### ⚠️ **If the Off-Gas System Is Overwhelmed**:

- If there’s **excess steam**, or the **charcoal beds saturate**, or the recombiner is bypassed:
    
    - Gases may reach the **stack faster**
        
    - Still **monitored** and may trigger **High Radiation Stack Alarm**
        
    - In extreme cases (e.g., SBO, LOCA), off-gas vents may **bypass full treatment** (emergency mode)

### 🔍 TL;DR:

> ✅ Yes, the **off-gas system vents to atmosphere**,  
> 🛑 **But only after processing**, delay, and monitoring — designed to **minimize radioactive release** and **meet EPA/NRC limits**.  
> It's **not a direct vent**, unless something fails badly.
