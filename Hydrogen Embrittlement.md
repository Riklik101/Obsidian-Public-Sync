As defined by a few research articles, hydrogen embrittlement is the polymerization of hydrogen dissolved in steel (or other items) into hydrogen molecules, causing stress concentrations that exceed the strength limitations of the steel, resulting in tiny cracks in said steel. once embrittlement has occured, it cannot be reversed.

This phenomenon can lead to hydrogen leaking, and deterioration to the perfromance of steel materials. However, it is not only limited to steel: iron, nickel, titanium, cobalt, and alloys are all susceptible (Side note, copper, aluminum, and stainless steels are less susceptible)

Embrittlement can come from a variety of sources, such as during manufacturing or due to poor techniques. fo example, poor arc welding practices resulting in teh release of hydrogen can result in hydrogen embrittlement. Otherwise, it can also occur from hydrogen sulfide, resulting in sulfide stress cracking, a problem in the oil & gas industry.

This is mainly affected by
- hydrogen concentration
- ambient pressure
- temperature
- exposure time
- stres state
- mechanical properties
- microstructure
- surface conditions
- nature of material crack front

Hydrogen embrittlement is closely linked to [[Cladding]] in nuclear reactors, such as [[BWR reactor]]s and [[RBMK Reactor]]s, as the hydrogen from zirconium alloy touching water can result in hydrogen embrittlement weakening the fuel rod structure and damaging the protective layer the zirconium alloy is meant for.
