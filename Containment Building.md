it is the reinforced steel/lead/concrete structure enclosing the nuclear reactor. 
It is designed to contain the escape of radioactive steam or gas between 275-550 kPa
- It is the forth step in the nuclear reactor defense-in-depth design against radioactive release
Either free standing or attached to a missile shield - must be strong enough to withstand a 9/11 attack

Although it is made to withstand accidents, it is NOT meant to condense/contain steam - like in the 3 mile and fukushima accidents - wherein in Three Mile gas was intentionally released to prevent overpressure, and fukishima all generators went down. 

Containment Buildings differ based on the type of reactor, but in general it is going to be bigger for PWRs (up to 7x) due to the design basis requiring adequate space for the steam/air mixture in the event of a LOCA. Most designs involve a combination of a sphere and a half spherical top - there are different designs.
